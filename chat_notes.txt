Linking a qtDesigner .ui file to python/pyqt?
So if I go into QtDesigner and build a UI, it'll be saved as a .ui file. How can I make this as a python file or use this in python?
 


[7:45] 
e.g this


[7:45] 
 ```import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui, uic

class MyWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyWindow, self).__init__()
        uic.loadUi('mywindow.ui', self)
        self.show()
```


[7:46] 
uic.loadUi('mywindow.ui', self) is there key thing there

saves on the build step that you see in most other plugin notes
